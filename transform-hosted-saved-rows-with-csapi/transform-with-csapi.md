# Use Content Services API to transform JSON into other formats
This demonstration shows how you can use [Hosted Saved Rows](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/rows/storage/hosted-saved-rows) to enable your end users to save and reuse content. It also incorporates [Content Services API](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/apis/content-services-api/content-services-api-reference), which, when enabled, allows your end users to export their designs in different formats such as:
- Plain Text
- HTML
- PDFs
- Images

Prior to using the `builder-with-csapi.html` file in this folder, ensure you complete the following steps:

1. Obtain a [Beefree SDK API key](https://developers.beefree.io/)
2. Reference [this repository](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-csapi-simple-integration) and follow the steps to set up your backend.

After completing those two steps, you can use the `builder-with-csapi.html` to discover how [Hosted Saved Rows](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/rows/storage/hosted-saved-rows) and [Content Services API](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/apis/content-services-api/content-services-api-reference) work together.
